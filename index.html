            like most other shooting games although there is violence compared to other shooting games this one is much
            better for kids as there is no gore or swearing or anything bad. shooting games also increase ur reaction
            time and ur aiming skills
<br>
<br>
            ->steam:
            steam is a platform where developers publish most of their games. most of these games are good for kids and
            there are many free ones too. u can read the description of all games which tell u the age rating and what u
            do in the game. steam is also safe. as far as i've been using it i have ran into 0 problems with something
            happening to my computer.
